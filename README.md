## Work Experience
**Procurement Agent @ The Boeing Company  (_March 2019 - Present_)**
- Extract and analyze Boeing internal and external data from various sources including procurement/contract system, IBI Cognos, SAP and Request for Proposals to develop and execute a complete procurement strategy, starting from market research, solicitation, price analysis, performance analysis, terms and condition negotiation, price negation, post contract management up to the final delivery of product to customers. 
- Retrieve data from the ERP system to identify critical parts with a high risk of late delivery. Collaborate with operations counterparts to address and resolve delivery issues promptly. Deliver a weekly report to the leadership team summarizing the status and actions taken to ensure timely deliveries.
- Navigate multiple ERP systems to identify upcoming order requests and aggregate the demand to build procurement package that can deliver the best pricing, quality and lead time to customers.
- Exhibit the exceptional ability to set the accurate target price even when internal pricing data is limited by collaborating with engineering and and performing price analysis using various tools such as Steffenson Price analysis, Average Labor Warp Rate. Consistently achieve the target price and beyond through negotiation and help program to save the budget for the research and development efforts. 

**Cargo Operation Agent @ Asiana Airlines (_February 2017 – Feb 2019_)**
- In charge of AOG operation for Boeing 747 freighter and 777 passenger. Ensured spare parts delivery on airplane, managing ramp operation, coordinating with mechanics, crew and Air Route Traffic Control Center, communicating the installation process and reporting to the hub station in S.Korea.
- Collected and analyzed actual cargo weight and chargeable weight and identified the weight discrepancy. Negotiated the discrepancy with business partners and increased sales revenue. 
- Led continuous improvement project by performing operational audit and root cause analysis for airport ramp operation. Identified security and performance non-conformities. Implemented corrective operation procedure and improve on-time departure for Boeing 747 cargo aircraft.

## Projects
### Future Sales Prediction
 - Predict future sales of 1C Company, a Russian software developer, using time series analysis. Decompose the data into the time series components to identify trend, seasonality and remainder, using Seasonal-Trend decomposition using LOESS (STL) and moving average smoothing. Mean, Naive and Random walk forecast are used to predict future sales.



### Twitter US Airline Sentiment
-Build machine learning models to analyze the sentiment of Tweet posts about US airlines. Multinomial Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine and Logistic regression models are used to classify the text based customers sentiment into three categories -Positive, Neutral, Negative. Visualize and compare the accuracy of each model. 


### House price prediction linear regression
-Build a deep learning model to predict the housing price in King county area.  Convolutional Neural network and rectified linear unit (ReLU) is used as activation function. Decreasing value of loss function is visualized to show the performance of model and the Mean Absolute Error and Mean Squared Error is used for the evaluation of model accuracy.
