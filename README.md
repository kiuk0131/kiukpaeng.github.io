## Projects
### Future Sales Prediction
 - Predict future sales of 1C Company, a Russian software developer, using time series analysis. Decompose the data into the time series components to identify trend, seasonality and remainder, using Seasonal-Trend decomposition using LOESS (STL) and moving average smoothing. Mean, Naive and Random walk forecast are used to predict future sales.


### Twitter US Airline Sentiment
- Build machine learning models to analyze the sentiment of Tweet posts about US airlines. Multinomial Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine and Logistic regression models are used to classify the text based customers sentiment into three categories -Positive, Neutral, Negative. Visualize and compare the accuracy of each model. 


### House price prediction linear regression
- Build a deep learning model to predict the housing price in King county area.  Convolutional Neural network and rectified linear unit (ReLU) is used as activation function. Decreasing value of loss function is visualized to show the performance of model and the Mean Absolute Error and Mean Squared Error is used for the evaluation of model accuracy.
